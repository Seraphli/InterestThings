# Game and AI

## An Experiment in Automatic Game Design

One of the key prerequisites for reaching flow is that the amount of challenge of the task is just about right: not too hard, and not too easy.

Malone [11] distinguishes between three factors that make games engaging: challenge, fantasy and curiosity.

While the right level of challenge is a key component of the flow concept as well, the other two factors are more game-specific; fantasy refers to how well the game evokes a sense of being somewhere else or doing something exotic, whereas curiosity means that environments should have an “optimal level of informational complexity”: novel but not incomprehensible.

For Koster, well-designed games are games that are easy to start playing, but where the difficulty curve is such that the player continuously learns something new while playing. i.e., games that take a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master.

Evolving Personas for Player Decision Modeling

Personas versus clones for player decision modeling

An interesting approach to AI-based testing is the use of procedural personas [265, 267]. These are data-driven inferred models of  dissimilar play styles that potentially imitate the different styles of human play.

## Gameflow: A model for evaluating player enjoyment in games

Flow experiences consist of eight elements:
1) a task that can be completed
2) ability to concentrate on the task
3) concentration is possible because the task has clear goals
4) concentration is possible because the task provides immediate feedback
5) ability to exercise a sense of control over actions
6) deep but effortless involvement that removes awareness of worries and frustrations of everyday life
7) concern for self disappears but sense of self emerges stronger afterwards
8) sense of duration of time is altered
